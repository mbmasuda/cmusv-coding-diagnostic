## What this package contains

This package contains the code I submitted as part of my
application to Carnegie Mellon University's program leading
to an M.S. in software engineering (technical track). Note
that the admissions process has changed since I was admitted
in 2012 and graduated in 2014, so I do not think that posting
my solution is giving anything away.

The instructions provided to applicants are included in this
package in `instructions.pdf` so you can see what we were
told about the business rules. Additionally, I've provided
`my-thought-process.pdf`, which describes how I turned the
information contained in `instructions.pdf` into the code
I submitted as my solution.

This was my first attempt at writing a Model–View–Controller
program.

## Object-oriented analysis and design resources

Some of the resources I've used to learn object-oriented
analysis and design that I've found very useful are:

*  [*Object-Oriented Design Using Java* by Dale Skrien](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Design-Using-Java-Skrien/dp/0072974168)
    *  Dale is an **awesome** computer science professor! Not
       only was his teaching very clear and rigorous, his emphasis
       on writing elegant software has served me well and I am
       forever grateful that I had the opportunity to take multiple
       classes with him, even though I probably wasn't the best
       student as an undergrad. Every time I think back to those
       long nights of Java, Common LISP, and Prolog, shivers of
       joy run down my spine! (Anyone who has ever taken a class
       with Dale will know what I mean.)

*  [*Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development, 3rd edition* by Craig Larman](https://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062)
    *  I used this book in an online class on object-oriented analysis
       and design that I took through UC Santa Cruz Extension.
